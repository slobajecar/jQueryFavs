This is a collection of my favourite jQuery scripts, snippets, plugins, widgets and all things jQuery specific
that I picked out from the web and find them very useful.

This plugin is used for client-side table sorting but also have a lot of flexibility for CSS classes, additional
pager plugins, widgets, AJAX support, custom parsers and many more.
